A wallpaper setting script written in Bash.

Made for the Cinnamon desktop environment though I'm sure other window managers wouldn't mind it.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Set random backgrounds automatically from $HOME/Wallpapers (Or another configured directory)
Usage examples:
./wallpaperSetter (optional extras: -help -debug -regendb/-regen)
