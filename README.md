# wallpaperSetter
A local script that I realized I don't want to lose.

This script can be called at any time (I usually bind it to a global hotkey in Cinnamon) and invoking it changes your wallpapers b ased on a set directory inside the script.

It uses 'xrandr' to check how many monitors you have, then fetches {x} new wallpapers to display on them with 'feh'.
